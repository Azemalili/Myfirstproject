<h1 align="center">CHARLES BUKOWSKI</h1>
<p>
    <b>Charles Bukowski</b> was born in Andrenach in Germany on August 16, 1920. Two years after his birth, the whole family emigrated to America. They settled in Los Angeles, where Bukowski stayed all his life. His whole life is written in books. His full name is Henry Charles Bukowski Jr., but he was simply called Henk. He died on March 9, 1994 from leukemia in San Pedro. He is the author of 34 volumes of poetry, 3 novels and a film script. Bukowski is known as one of the founders of the <q>Underground</q>stream of artistic writing.
    <br />
    By 1960, Bukowski had returned to the post office in Los Angeles and began work as a letter filing clerk, a position he held for more than a decade. In 1962, he was distraught over the death of Jane Cooney Baker, his first serious girlfriend. Bukowski turned his inner devastation into a series of poems and stories lamenting her death.

        Henry <strong> Charles Bukowski</strong> was a German-American poet,
    novelist, and short story writer. His writing was influenced by the social,
    cultural, and economic ambience of his adopted home city of <abbr title="Los Angeles" >L.A</abbr>.Bukowski's work addresses the ordinary lives of poor Americans, the act of writing, relationships with women, and the drudgery of work. <dfn>The <b>FBI</b> kept a file on him as a result of his column <em>Notes of a Dirty Old Man</em> in the <abbr title="Los Angeles" >L.A</abbr> underground newspaper Open City.</dfn>

<p>
        During his lifetime, Bukowski received little attention from academic critics in the USA, but was better received in Europe, particularly the UK, and especially Germany, where he was born. Since his death in March 1994, Bukowski has been the subject of a number of critical articles and books about both his life and writings.

        <s>Over half of Bukowski's collections have been published posthumously. Posthumous collections have been known to have been 'John Martinized', with the poems having been highly edited, at a level which was not present during Bukowski's lifetime. One example of a popular poem, "Roll the Dice" , themes such as hell and alcoholism are removed. The creative editing present includes changing lines from "against total rejection and the highest of odds" to "despite rejection and the worst odds</s>

<h3>Quote by Charles Bukowski</h3>
<blockquote>
    - there are worse things than being alone<br />
    but it often takes decades to realize this<br />
    and most often when you do it's too late<br />
    and there's nothing worse than too late.<br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    - I was a man who thrived on solitude;<br />
    without it I was like another man without food or water.<br />
    Each day without solitude weakened me.<br />
    I took no pride in my solitude;<br />
    but I was dependent on it. <br />
    The darkness of the room was like sunlight to me.<br />
